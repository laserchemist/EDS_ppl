blurb: Hi everyone! My name is Mohammad Ahnaf Shahriar. I’m a junior international student from Bangladesh majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Finance. I enjoy playing chess and watching stock prices go down—especially the ones I can’t afford yet, and trust me, that’s most of them. Feel free to reach out to me with classwork questions or if you need any guidance. I’m always happy to help!
