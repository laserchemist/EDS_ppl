blurb: I’m a Temple alumnus, having earned my PhD in Physics here. But before you picture me as Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory, let me stop you right there. I promise I’m far less likely to knock three times on your door.<br>My research interests lie primarily in Soft Condensed Matter, where I’ve worked with everything from crude oil and blood to liquid chocolate. (Yes, sometimes science really is delicious!)<br>And when I’m not on campus, you’ll usually find me in my garage, happily elbows‑deep in engine parts while trying to convince my car to love me back. After all, car engineering is really just physics with more grease.
